## Content

Couple of points about the content of the repo and what has been added/updated:
1. 'ta_assigment' folder has been copied from https://github.com/busy-fox/ta_assignment
2. Added Dockerfile and 'bring_up_and_run_tests.sh' script which used by the same Dockerfile and of course .travis.yml to integrate with Travis CI.
3. The only change which has been done under 'ta_assigment', was test-case regolden. Updated expecting message to make all tests passed.
